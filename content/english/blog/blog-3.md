The ulama PPME Den Haag has defined the **Zakat Fitrah** and the **Fidyah** for Ramadan 1443H :

* Zakat Fitrah is per persoon € 10,-
* Fidyah is €10,-per day

You can pay both your Zakat Fitrah and your Fidyah at PPME Den Haag. We will take the responsibility to distribute the received funds to the rightful mustahik. Your Shodaqoh is also welcome to support our activities at PPME Den Haag.

You can pay the **Zakat** or the **Fidyah**  by online transfer using the following code.
