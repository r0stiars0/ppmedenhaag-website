Assalamu alaykum,<br/>
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim, dear members of PPME.

Our brothers and sisters in Sumatera are currently being tested by disasters. Many of them have lost their homes, possessions, and even have to struggle to meet their daily basic needs. Most urgently, there is a pressing need for medicines for chronic and infectious diseases. In these difficult circumstances, our helping hands are greatly needed.

**PPME Den Haag**, in collaboration with **Dompet Dhuafa**, is working to distribute aid directly to the disaster victims in Sumatera. InshaAllah, the donations you entrust will be distributed responsibly and reach those who truly need them.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

> “Whoever relieves a believer of hardship in this world, Allah will relieve him of hardship on the Day of Resurrection.” (HR. Muslim)

Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala also says:

> “And cooperate in righteousness and piety.” (QS. Al-Ma’idah: 2)

Helping fellow Muslims affected by disaster is not only a form of social concern but also a path to gaining rewards and Allah's help. Every charity we give, no matter how small, will InshaAllah become a source of blessing and protection from Allah SWT.

Let us ease the burden of our brothers and sisters in Sumatera. It is time to share, it is time to care.

Donations can be channeled through PPME Den Haag in collaboration with Dompet Dhuafa via: <br/><br/>
IBAN **NL26 INGB 0002 1661 44**<br/>
In the name of: PPME Den Haag<br/>
