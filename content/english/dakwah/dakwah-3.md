The PPME was founded in the 1970s by a group of Islamic Indonesian students. To this day you can taste the atmosphere and see the customs that are typical of Indonesia and Indonesians.


The Indonesian spoken meetings are also still organised. They take place on the second half of Saturday. Usually before or after the Maghrib prayer.


A meeting lasts about 1 to 2 hours and alternately consists of reading the Qurâ€™an together, dhikr and lectures on fiqh and aqidah. And sometimes there are guest speakers from Indonesia.

FAQ:

* Do I have to be a member of the association first?
* What are the costs to become a member?
