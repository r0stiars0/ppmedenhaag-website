Assalamu’alaikum warohmatullahi wa barakatuh

Today we begin the celebration of the 51st anniversary of the PPME. We literally start with a “Kick-off”. In it, Mba **Wati Chaeron** explains, among other things, what the plans are for the coming year that will be dominated by this beautiful milestone.

Mba Wati closes the kick-off with a special conversation with **Arif Widyantoro**, the son of alm. Bapak Muhamad Hisyam. Bapak Muhamad Hisyam wrote a book 26 years ago about the 25th anniversary of the PPME.

You can participate in the kick-off via Zoom. The link for this has now been distributed. Don't have a link? A live stream will be set up via YouTube so that you can watch live. The video is saved so you can watch it again.

See <a href="{{<ref "blog/ppme-51">}}">here</a> as well as other activities.

Wassalamu'alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh
