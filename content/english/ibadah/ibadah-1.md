Marriage in Islam is a form of worship. By entering into a marriage you fulfill half of your religion. Marriage changes the relationship between a man and a woman. What used to be haram is now halal. Marriage is a sacred event and has the value of worship. PPME The Hague can help to complete marriage according to Islamic teachings.
