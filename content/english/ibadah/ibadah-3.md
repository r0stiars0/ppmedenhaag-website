A convert is one who has joined Islam. In order to do this, you must pronounce the shahadah. After pronouncing the shahadah, one is called a Muslim.
The words you need to say to become a Muslim are:


> **I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is his prophet.**

 
PPME Den Haag facilitates the process of accession to Islam. For example, by bringing interested parties into contact with an imam. Together, questions can be answered and any ambiguities can be clarified.

### Are you interested?

You can fill in this [form (in Netherlands language)](/forms/Mualaf_Formulier_NL.docx). We use the data for the certificate you receive after joining.
 

Have you completed the form?

You can then send an email to {{< param email >}} to make an appointment at the mosque or come by on Saturdays from 4 p.m.
Please bring a copy of your identification along with the form when you visit the mosque. For example, a passport or identity card with photo.
During the appointment in the mosque we discuss when the accession will take place.
We will try as much as possible to hold the accession during our Saturday meetings.
