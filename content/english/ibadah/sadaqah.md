Islam offers us more than a way to purify ourselves of our shortcomings. Providing support to people who need material or moral support is an example of this. But even a sincere smile can already help you to have your shortcomings and sins forgiven by Allah SWT. It's a simple form of charity. And charity is a form of worship.

 
### Zakat
It belongs to one of the five pillars of Islam. It is an obligation on a Muslim to spend a prescribed portion of his/her wealth to those who are entitled to it.

 
### Infaq
This is the voluntary spending of wealth or property for the sole purpose of pleasing Allah SWT, without seeking anything in return.


### Sadaqah
This is the voluntary giving of money, resources, knowledge and support to the needy.
In the Qur'an Allah SWT describes the importance of charity:

 
> *Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a good loan will have it multiplied for them, and they will have an honourable reward.* [**Al-Hadid: 18**](https://quran.com/57/18)
