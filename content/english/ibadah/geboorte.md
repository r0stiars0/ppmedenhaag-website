The birth of a child is a gift from Allah SWT. It is a trust given to parents. One of the rituals for welcoming a newborn baby is aqiqah. With this we show our gratitude to Allah for the birth of the child.

Besides the recommended ritual, the slaughter of a sheep, there is also the cutting of the hair. PPME Den Haag facilitates the latter during the Indonesian meeting in the evening program on Saturday.

### What does that look like?

Those present that evening stand in a room and melodically read the Salawat nabi. At the same time, the parents walk past those present. One parent carries the baby in their arms, the other holds a bowl with a bowl of water, scissors and a cloth on it. It is then the intention that all those present cut off a piece of hair or brush a little water on the head of the baby. After this evening, the parents can continue at home with the complete shaving of the hair.

If you would you like an aqiqah to be arranged for your baby at PPME The Hague, or if you have questions about this, you may contact us at {{< param email >}}
